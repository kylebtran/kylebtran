Hi! My name is Kyle Tran.

I'm a software engineer at the University of California, Irvine, developing research tools that analyze and optimize student curricula. My work is dedicated toward improving the visualization and protection of over 4.17 million lines of student data.

Though my hobbies come and go, I'm currently interested in:
- Mountain biking
- Illustration
- User experience
- Hackathons

Feel free to reach out! 🎐
