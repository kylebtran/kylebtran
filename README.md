# Hey, I'm Kyle Tran!

I build practical and performant solutions that interface with a multitude of designs and technologies which I have grown to love. Whether the task calls for simplicity or maximalism, my focus is always on the user.

Incoming at Meta, previously at Lucid Motors whilst studying Computer Science at UC Irvine.
