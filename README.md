# Hi! My name is Kyle Tran.

I'm studying Computer Science at the University of California, Irvine, whilst I develop research tools that analyze and optimize student curricula. My work is dedicated toward improving the visualization and protection of over 4.17 million lines of student data, mission-critical avionics software @ UCI CubeSat, and website design/user experience @ Hack at UCI.

Though my hobbies come and go, I'm currently interested in:
- Mountain biking
- Illustration
- User experience
- Hackathons

Feel free to reach out! üéê
