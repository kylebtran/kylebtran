# Hi! My name is Kyle Tran üéê

I'm a creative developer passionate about building full stack 0-to-1 software, embedded systems, and human-centered interactions.

Currently studying Computer Science at UC Irvine, I build practical and performant solutions that interface with a multitude of designs and technologies which I have grown to love. Whether the task calls for simplicity or maximalism, my focus is always on the user.

Recently, I've been working on:
- Architecting 60+ microservices and deploying agentic AI at scale for Lucid Motors.
- Developing tools to analyze and optimize student curricula at UCI OIT, safeguarding and visualizing over 4.17 million lines of data.
- Engineering mission-critical avionics software at UCI CubeSat.
- Designing and enhancing web experiences at Hack at UCI.
