# Hi! My name is Kyle Tran 🎐

I'm studying Computer Science at the University of California, Irvine, whilst I develop research tools that analyze and optimize student curricula. My work is dedicated toward improving the visualization and protection of over 4.17 million lines of student data @ UCI OIT 💻, mission-critical avionics software @ UCI CubeSat 🛰️, and website design/user experience @ Hack at UCI 🛠️.
